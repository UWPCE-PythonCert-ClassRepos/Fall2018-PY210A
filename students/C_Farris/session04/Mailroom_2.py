Created by: Carol Farris
Purpose: Mailroom 2
Goal: Use Anaconda linter to write PEP8 Python code
    Comment functions correctly
    Use dict to switch between users selections (completed),
    write thank you letter to the file,
    try to use the dict and .format() to produce the template
    rather than using one big string.
Note: not all Pep8 fixes were completed. Minor fixes remain
      Will work on those in Mailroom_3.
