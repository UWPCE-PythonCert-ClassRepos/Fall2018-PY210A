## ReadMe

###  What make's me me,
 --Things that I am exposed to and raise in over my life time. As old as I may be I am still learning me. 
Each of us is unique. (morality, identity and fairness,)

-- Borrowed this from my former coworker - Captain /KevinN
**Remember…**
*    _Keep things simple (don't over-architect)_
*    _Think about the big picture. How does X fit in? How can Y be used in the future?_
*    _Keep learning new things – Build up your toolset and ONLY use when appropriate_.
*    _Keep listening to others and their ideas. Spoiler: You don't know everything. I certainly don't_.
*    _Keep things fun_ – It's just r3c!p3$ :)㋡ ㋛ ☺ ☹ ☻
