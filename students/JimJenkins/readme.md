# Jim Jenkins Project Site

This site contains the assignments and some extra files for the Python 210A course at UW in Seattle.

## Getting Started

The files are divided into lesson numbers, each lesson correlates to a specific class. The difficulty of the coding increases as the session numbers increase.

* **Lesson 01 -** 
* **Lesson 02 -** 
* **Lesson 03 -**
* **Lesson 04 -** 
* **Lesson 05 -** 
* *...*

### Prerequisites

These code samples were written in Python 3 (3.7 to be exact) which you will need running to make these samples work.

To validate you are running the proper python version, open a cmd window (Windows) or a bash window (MAC or Linux).

```
python --version
```
