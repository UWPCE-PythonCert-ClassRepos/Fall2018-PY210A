    Write a program which prints the full path for all files in the current directory, one per line
    Write a program which copies a file from a source, to a destination (without using shutil, or the OS copy command).
        Advanced: make it work for any size file: i.e. don’t read the entire contents of the file into memory at once.
        This should work for any kind of file, so you need to open the files in binary mode: open(filename, 'rb')
        (or 'wb' for writing). Note that for binary files, you can’t use readline() – lines don’t have any meaning for
        binary files.
        Test it with both text and binary files (maybe jpeg or something of your choosing).
