## Welcome, Students!

When you join the course, please do the following:

1. Create a directory named after you. This is a public repository, so if you want to remain anonymous, you don't need to use your full name.
  * It can be your first name.
  * It can be your GitHub handle.
  * It can be an arbitrary nickname &mdash; just make sure to let your instructor know!

2. Create a README for your directory.
  * Feel free to personalize it a bit! You can make these pages with [Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) or [ReStructuredText](http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html).
  * Share some things about what makes you you.
  * Tell us what you want to get out of this course.
